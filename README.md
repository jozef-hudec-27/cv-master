# CV-master

## Overview

CV-master is a React application that allows users to create a CV or resume for themselves. The project is a part of [The Odin Project course on ReactJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-cv-application), and it was created to provide an understanding of some of the basic principles of using React.

## Features

- Editable fields for the user's name and contact information
- Dynamic forms that allow users to enter details on their education, work experience and skills
- Editable image that allows users to upload their own

## Notes

This is the first app that I have built using React, and it was designed to provide a foundational understanding of how React works (props, state).
